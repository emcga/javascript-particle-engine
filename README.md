# A Simple JavaScript Particle Engine

This is a simple JavaScript particle engine I built in an evening, just for fun. If you add anthing to it,
please share!
<br>
<br>

## To Run
Open up your terminal and run the following commands. Please make sure you have nodejs and npm installed.

```1. npm install```

```2. npm run server```

At this point http-server should be listening on port 8080. Open up your favorite HTML5 compliant browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080. (note: Chrome seems to be most performant)

## Potential Issues

If you make changes to the engine.js file and refresh the browser, but nothing happens, please disable your browsers cache option.
